# Invoicer

Used for invoicing needs. This is a personal project so that I can learn how to develop C# api controllers and how to use them to perform CRUD operations to a MySQL database and also show the data on a browser using React.

### TODO

- Add company to print transaction page
- Test everything to make sure it works
- Host on Raspberry Pi
