# Invoicer

Used for invoicing needs. This is a personal project so that I can learn how to develop C# api controllers and how to use them to perform CRUD operations to a MySQL database and also show the data on a browser using React.

This project is complete and I got it successfully running on the Raspberry pi using apache.

### Enhancements

- Stop opening transactions in a new tab. It's getting annoying
- When editing a company, show the new name of the company in the dropdown and also save attributes locally
- Save selected company locally so that the user doesn't have to keep switching back when refreshing
- Add option to delete company and all data associated with it.
- Add option to delete customer and all data associated with it.
- Add user login and access functionality
- Add option to delete user and all data associated with it.
