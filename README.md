# Invoicer

Used for invoicing needs. This is a personal project so that I can learn how to develop C# api controllers and how to use them to perform CRUD operations to a MySQL database and also show the data on a browser using React.

### TODO

- Work on making Companies dropdown for home and settings page
- If company is selected on Home, load customers for that company
- If company is selected on Customer Settings, allow customer to be submitted with that company
