# Invoicer

Used for invoicing needs. This is a personal project so that I can learn how to develop C# api controllers and how to use them to perform CRUD operations to a MySQL database and also show the data on a browser using React.

### TODO

- Work on renaming companies to customers and making companies have separate customers
- Finish Transactions Controller connection to db
- Finish Companies Controller connection to db
- Make buttons functional
