# Invoicer

Used for invoicing needs. This is a personal project so that I can learn how to develop C# api controllers and how to use them to perform CRUD operations to a MySQL database and also show the data on a browser using React.

### TODO

- Redo the transaction and company validation with JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<Class> method
- Finish Transactions Controller connection to db
- Finish Companies Controller connection to db
- Make buttons functional
