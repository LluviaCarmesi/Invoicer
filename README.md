# Invoicer

Used for invoicing needs. This is a personal project so that I can learn how to develop C# api controllers and how to use them to perform CRUD operations to a MySQL database and also show the data on a browser using React.

This project is complete and I got it successfully running on the Raspberry Pi 4 using apache.

### Enhancements

- Add user login and access functionality
- Add option to hide user and all data associated with it.
- Make the site mobile-friendly
